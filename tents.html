<div class="about"><h2>
  Tents, Tarps, Poles, Tie Downs, and Stakes: You’ll need something to sleep in, 
so a tent should be at the top of your priority list. There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all 
tent though. Tents come in a variety of sizes and in a variety of types.
Dome tents are pretty common for car camping likely because
people appreciate the extra headroom but cheap tents are likely to leak. 
Applying some waterproofing may help but you can also cover your tent to help keep the rain out.
You might also want to consider tarps to put on the floor.
Some ultralight tents are best suited for backpacking, while other, heavier tents come with spacious 
luxuries best suited for hanging out near a car. To confuse matters more, most tents come in two varieties: three-season and 
four-season. Three-season tents are good for just about anything but the deep of winter, while
four-season tents have more durable fabric that can handle snowdrifts. 
Sleeping Bags and Sleeping Pads: Like tents, sleeping bags come in different weights 
and handle different temperatures, so you have to do some research to find the one best suited for you,
where you plan to camp, and when.  Cheap sleeping bags probably won’t keep you as warm and 
cheap air mattresses will probably have you sleeping on the ground by morning. 
If you’re not ready to buy quality equipment, consider borrowing or renting it.</h2></div>
