<h2>What you should take on your camping trip depends on what type of trip you have in mind. 
Let’s start with the most obvious camping-specific equipment: 
Tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, headlamps, lantern and flashlights,hiking boots or shoes
paper maps, first aid kit,stove, fuel and fire starter,food, pots and pans, cups bowls and utensils,
dishcloths, some type of scrub brush, coolers and trash bags.
Whatever you buy and pack, just make sure to consider your climate, needs, and environment. 
Perhaps you want to get some fishing in, in which case you will need a pole, permit, and some bait. 
Maybe you are going on a big bike camping trip, which requires not only camping gear, 
but also a slew of cycling-specific extras. The fact is, regardless of the 
millions of generic camping checklists out there, they are all pretty much garbage because they are just massive lists 
of almost random items. For everything beyond the basics above, you’re much better off searching 
for checklists suited to the specific trip you are planning.

<div class="text"><h2><strong>1. Research</strong></h2></div>
<h2>Don’t just choose any campsite to camp in, choose one that you would like.
Do some research and when you’ve got what you want, go and make a reservation. 
You can just drive to a campground and check in but there is no guarantee you will get a spot. 
There are a lot of campgrounds available and most of them are listed on the internet.
If you need to shower, make sure the campground has shower facilities or carry your
own portable camp shower. Different campground also cater for a variety of experiences 
including hiking, island camping, boating, beaches, areas with picnic tables and more.
Your main goal in your research is to go for a campground where you’ll have as much fun
as possible and one which fulfills all your needs.</h2>

<div class="text"><h2><strong>2. Sleep</strong></h2></div>
<h2>Sleep may not come easily for you especially for a beginner.
For padding and insulation, use an inflatable camping mat or you
might prefer a camping cot. For car camping, I would take a padded camping cot 
for the comfort. What I like about cots is that you don’t have to worry about sharp rocks
and roots on the ground.</h2>

<div class="usa"><img src="img/cb3.jpg" width="70%"></div>
<div class="text"><h2><strong>3. Food</strong></h2></div>
<h2>Make sure you have the proper camping cookware like pots, pans, spoon, fork, etc. Plan your meals 
and pack all the required ingredients. Remember the salt and pepper and condiments that you want to use. 
It is not a bad idea to practice preparing your camping food at home.
Bring along some easy-to-make food like instant soup or noodles just in case.
Also bring a grill if you want to cook over the campfire and if not, don’t forget your camp stove. 
Your camp stove should always be tested at home before you go on your camping trip.
Remember that you need to clean up after meals and that means washing up your dishes. 
Take disposable paper dishes, bowls and utensils if you want to avoid washing them. 
This doesn’t mean you can avoid any washing at all because you need to clean the pots. 
Bring your own washing soap and dish towel.
If you prefer not to cook at all, look for a campground near a city so you can go 
to a restaurant and buy some food.</h2>

<div class="usa"><img src="img/cb4.jpg" width="70%"></div>
<div class="text"><h2><strong>4. Enjoy</strong></h2></div>
<h2>It is your first time but don’t worry too much. You might encounter some problems on your trip 
but don’t let that stop you from enjoying the trip. Everything does not have to be perfect.</h2>
